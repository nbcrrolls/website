                  <h4>Overview</h4>
		  <p>This workflow was built with Kepler actors. Amber tool - cpptraj - is required to run the workflow. 
                     Please make sure cpptraj is installed and the path to cpptraj is stored in bash file. 
		     Amber13 tools is licensed under GNU (General Public License) and is free to the general public. 
		     You can download cpptraj from the <a class="reglink" href="http://ambermd.org/#AmberTools">Amber website</a>. 
		     Gromos clustering is done on the NBCR (National Biomedical Computation Resource) web server. 
		  </p>
		  <p>This workflow includes five main components:
                    <ol>
			<li><span class="actor">Trajectories Listing</span> takes all the trajectories for the cluster and 
			    compiles them into one trajectory file. The trajectories of interest must all be in the same folder. </li>
			<li><span class="actor">PDB Creator</span> takes the trajectory generated in the first component and 
			    converts it to pdb. Pdb files are the input for gromos clustering. The trajectories will be aligned based on user input. </li>
			<li><span class="actor">PDB Modifieer</span> modifies the pdb files. It deletes the first line of each frame 
			    (non-atom information) and changes the ending of each frame from END to ENDMDL. 
			    All these modifications are required to prepare gromos clustering input. </li>
			<li><span class="actor">Atom selection</span> generates a pdb file that contains 
			    all the atoms chosen for clustering. For example, if users want to cluster all the 
			    trajectories based on the alpha helix near the protein active site, this component will write 
			    a pdb file consists only the alpha helix.</li>
			<li><span class="actor">Clustering</span> is where the clustering actually occurs. First, the pdb input files generated 
			    from previous steps are compressed as required by the NBCR gromos clustering web server. Then, 
			    the zipped files are sent to the server where the clustering job runs. After clustering is done, 
			    outputs are transferred back to local machine. Two files are downloaded: log file which 
			    contains clustering information and a compressed (tar.gz) file which holds all outputs generated from the 
			    NBCR gromos clustering web server.  </li>
                    </ol>
                  </p>
