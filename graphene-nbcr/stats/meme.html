      NBCR hosted MEME suit of application through May of 2015. <br>
      As of June, 2015 MEME developers are using their own web server.<br><br>

      During 2015 MEME develoeprs switched recording user emails to recording a <br>
      unique browser session ID in the MEME Suite log files. This was required by the<br>
      journal NAR, which insisted that on-line tools not require a user to input<br>
      their email address.  As a result, the user ids in the log files for 2015<br>
      are a mix of email addresses and made-up ids and are not possible to represent <br>
      by user uniq domain.<br><br>

      The number of uniq sessions for the period of January - May 2015 was 10228
      which accoubnts for repeate and new users.<br>
