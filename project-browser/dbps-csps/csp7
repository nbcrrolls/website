Schematic of the Auditory central nervous system.
DESCRIPTION
The auditory system, in addition to monitoring environmental sounds for survival purposes, is the 
sensory modality for many species that offers the broadest dimensions for intraspecies communication. 
Unlike other mammalian sensory systems, the auditory system consists of many neuronal processing 
stations between the peripheral receptors in the cochlea and the beginning of cortical processing 
in the temporal lobe. Nonetheless, cochlear pathology is excessively weighted in explanations of 
congenital and acquired hearing loss. Emerging pictures of misformed central circuitry and altered 
physiology now shed light on a range of auditory spectrum disorders such as dyslexia and autism that 
affect rapid processing of temporal information.

Our project will deliver the first detailed wiring diagram of the front-end central nervous system 
processor for auditory information and address a common critique of "connectomics" by merging 
structural with functional information.
