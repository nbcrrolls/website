DESCRIPTION
This project is developing more accurate representations of cell processes and compartments to allow computational modeling 
of changes relevant to brain tumor development and cancer progression and explore the role of astrocytes in neurodegenerative 
disorders. We are combining our expertise in complex modeling and the underlying mathematics to create cell-centered 
representations to propel NBCR's work on development of new modeling and simulation tools.

We are focusing on a key aspect of simulations that will use the representation of simplified astrocytes suitable for the 
study of their roles in normal and abnormal brain metabolism. The resulting deeper understanding of the spatio-temporal 
aspects of astrocytes and their role in brain-energy metabolism might provide a unifying perspective on a broad range 
of neuropathologies, including glioma and Parkinson's disease.

Figures show Left: The brain consists of different cell types, each specialized for specific tasks (Allen 2009). 
Middle: An astrocyte (green) surrounds a neuron (red) with its fine processes (Ellisman lab). 
Right: Complex 3D morphology of an astrocyte with 3D reconstructions of the colored regions (Shigetomi 2013).
