DESCRIPTION
APOBEC3 or A3 enzymes are DNA cytosine deaminases that catalyze C-to-U conversion in single-stranded 
DNA. With seven members (A3A, A3B, A3C, A3D, A3F, A3G, A3H) in humans, the A3 enzyme family works 
as an arm of the innate immune system targeting foreign DNA for destruction. A3 enzymes have 
significant roles in multiple diseases including HIV/AIDS pathogenesis and cancer mutagenesis.

The primary goal of our work is structure- and ligand-based lead optimization of recently identified 
weak inhibitors of A3 enzymes using state-of-the-art MD simulations and virtual screening. We are 
applying a multidisciplinary approach to identify small-molecule inhibitors of several important A3 
enzymes that can serve as drug leads targeting HIV pathogenesis, cancer mutagenesis, and genetic engineering.
