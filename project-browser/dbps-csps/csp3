DESCRIPTION
Though usually harmless, S. aureus may lead to ear infections, sinusitis, pneumonia, meningitis, toxic 
shock syndrome, and a number of postsurgical infections. Typically patients are prescribed antibiotics 
(e.g., penicillins) that inhibit bacterial cell-wall formation. However, in recent years many 
pathogenic bacteria have become resistant to this drug class after acquiring the b-lactamase enzyme, 
which breaks down penicillin-like antibiotics.

As a consequence of this emerging resistance, new drug leads are needed urgently. Drugs 
targeting members of the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway are particularly promising. Specifically, 
undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (UPPS) is currently being studied because it is essential 
for bacterial cell growth and has no close human homologues.

The objective of this CSP is to develop new antibacterial drugs. Working with experimentalists, 
NBCR researchers have already aided in the discovery of UPPS inhibitors that were subsequently 
optimized to nanomolar affinity. Continued computational efforts will require novel CADD methods 
(e.g., methods that draw upon accelerated MD), which we will implement as BiSiDE workflows so 
others in the community can easily apply these advances in their own work.
