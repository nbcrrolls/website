DESCRIPTION
Within the physiological modeling community, computational modeling of the heart has emerged as arguably the most advanced 
exemplar of integrated cell-to-organ simulation. As such, the heart represents a highly promising candidate for 
demonstrating the potential of a systems biology approach for integrating across spatial and temporal scales of resolution 
to increase understanding of function and disease processes. 

The goal of this project is to develop a rat cardiac modeling framework and species-specific models for (i) experimental 
design, testing, and hypothesis generation for experimental driven research; (ii) integration with other organ and 
system models; and (iii) providing a foundation for quantifying genotype-phenotype relationships. Our multi-scale 
approach will allow the Virtual Physiological Rat group to tackle several questions that have been difficult to address, 
owing to the complex and coupled nature of the metabolo-electro-contractile activation and relaxation process.
