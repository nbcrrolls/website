DESCRIPTION
The main outcome of this project will be assembly of a molecular-to-cellular scale model of two of the key bridging proteins 
at synapses, neurexin and neuroligin, aligning structural details from crystallographic studies with emerging results from in 
situ electron microscopy (EM) showing patterning of these molecules bridging the synaptic cleft. In addition, these 
molecules are thought to associate with key proteins mediating presynaptic vesicle release at active zones and postsynaptic 
neurotransmitter receptor clustering in the dendritic surface. 

This interconnected trans-synaptic complex may play a role in 
precisely aligning and maintaining the relative positions of the transmitter release machinery and chemosensitive postsynaptic 
receptor channels of synapses. 

This project bridges molecular structure of key molecules with high resolution/mesoscale 3D microscopy using new genetic 
probes for correlated light microscopy and EM. The immediate biomedical impact pertains to developmental disorders but 
implications are much broader, including neurodegenerative disease and aging.
