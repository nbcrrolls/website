Generalized neuron dendrite branch.
DESCRIPTION
In cardiac muscle, calcium sparks represent activity of the molecular machinery responsible for coupling plasma membrane 
depolarization to release of calcium from a form of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), known as the sarcoplasmic 
reticulum (SR), to elicit contraction of the muscle. Neuronal calcium sparks are found to be very prominent at 
dendrite branch points and their role is not known, but involvement of SER is predicted based on previous RyR localizations.

Neuronal dendrites are complicated structures in terms of their elaborate, tree-like morphology and their very extensive 
internal membrane system of branching SER. Despite descriptions of an interconnected SER network in neuronal dendrites by 
early serial section 3D EM and the presence of both RyR and IP3R calcium release channels on this anastomosing endomembrane 
system, our understanding of the physiological roles and precise locations of calcium release processes inside dendrites 
remains woefully incomplete.

This project leverages recent development of methods to reconstruct large volumes of neuronal axons and dendrites using 
serial block-face electron microscopy (EM) and serial-section electron tomography, and advances in models for 3D EM data 
sets for their reuse as substrates for computational simulation of physiology. As the sample is carried forward from light 
microcopy (LM) to higher-resolution EM, the technical challenges include locating the exact same area from LM that corresponds 
to where a spark was recorded in a branch point of an individual neuronal dendrite in the EM volume of data.

Figure shows a cartoon of generalized neuron dendrite branch points with the putative distribution of select channels on the SER and plasma membrane.
