Conformational change in PKA's regulatory subunit regulated through cAMP and PKA's catalytic subunit.
DESCRIPTION
The goal of this project is to understand how protein structure translates into the subcellular mechanism of action within 
macromolecular complexes. We are exploring these fundamental questions within the context of cyclic-adenosine 
mono-phosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A's (PKA) regulatory subunits (R) in cardiomyocytes.

This project represents a new paradigm for multi-scale modeling in which association rates and free-energy landscapes 
derived from molecular-scale simulations are integrated into mathematical models representing subcellular-scale events 
and macromolecular complexes. Successful completion will generate multi-scale computational models of PKA, linking atomic-level 
structures through free-energy landscapes and association rates to models of subcellular regulation. These models will 
provide insight into the functional mechanism of the #-adrenergic pathway PKA in the cardiomyocyte and develop key 
technologies and methods for integrating dispersed biological and chemical information into a coherent model that will 
support prediction and study of small molecules and mutations in the function of the cell.
